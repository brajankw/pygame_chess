# pygame_chess

The project was created for a course credit at university. I decided to do chess, because I'm a big fan. </br>
Project was written in python 3.11.0 with few default libralies and pygame and pygame_menu. </br>

pygame_chess supports games between 2 players, computer as enemy isn't implemented yet </br>
